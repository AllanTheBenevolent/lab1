	<h4>Project Portfolio</h4>

	<!-- p means paragraph -->
	<p>I am a young entrepreneur looking for opportunities to utilize the skills and assets I’ve attained from college. I’m also a philanthropist who believes that kindness is the greatest quality of being human. I’m a get right into work type of guy who has involved himself and managed various projects. I love to cook and eat delicious food. I love to build relations with people and listen to their life stories and their ideals. I'm still searching for what I really want to do but the statement that I'll always stand by is: "Kindness is the language I speak".</p>
